### prompt
Create a Telegram bot that plays a number-guessing game with each user. The bot picks a random number in a given range (default 1–100) and responds to each guess with ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ until the user guesses correctly. Track game state per chat/user, handle invalid input gracefully, and provide commands: /start, /newgame, /range (e.g., /range 1 1000), /help. After a win, show the number of attempts and offer to start a new game.
