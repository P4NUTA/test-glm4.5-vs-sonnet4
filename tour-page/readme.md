Project: “Tour Planner 55+ for Leningrad Oblast” — Generate 1–3-day itineraries optimized for comfort of 55+ travelers (few transfers, low stairs), with budget estimates, travel time, and rainy-day alternatives. Default UI language: Russian (with simple switch to EN). No external APIs — use local mock data only.
Important behavior rules (follow strictly):
Do not ask clarifying questions. Make reasonable assumptions and proceed.
Output everything in one single response, in the order below: Phase 1 plan → Phase 2 code (full repo) → Phase 3 validation → Post-mortem.
Use deterministic seeds; never hard-code secrets; handle invalid input gracefully; return helpful error messages.
Keep images/libs lightweight; containers production-ready; add healthchecks; pass all checks in docker-compose.
```

Plan:
Tour Planner 55+ for Leningrad Oblast - Implementation Plan

     Phase 1: Architecture & Planning

     - Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite for fast development
     - Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive design optimized for older users (larger fonts, high contrast)
     - State Management: Context API for language switching and tour data
     - Data Storage: Local JSON mock data for destinations, accommodations, transport
     - Deployment: Docker containerization with nginx for production

     Phase 2: Core Features Implementation

     1. Landing Page with Russian/English language toggle
     2. Tour Generator Form: Days (1-3), budget range, accessibility preferences
     3. Itinerary Display: Day-by-day breakdown with comfort features highlighted
     4. Budget Calculator: Accommodation, transport, meals, entrance fees
     5. Accessibility Features: Low stairs indicators, few transfers, comfort ratings
     6. Weather Alternatives: Indoor activities for rainy days
     7. Local Mock Data: 15+ destinations in Leningrad Oblast with detailed info

     Phase 3: Production Setup

     - Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
     - Nginx configuration for static file serving
     - Health checks and production optimizations
     - Error handling and input validation
     - Performance optimizations for older devices

     Key Technical Decisions:

     - No external APIs - all data stored locally in JSON
     - Responsive design with accessibility focus (WCAG 2.1 AA)
     - Russian as default language with simple EN toggle
     - Deterministic random generation using seeded algorithms
     - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

    Post-Mortem
    
    - Assumptions: Start/end in Saint Petersburg; 55+ means avoid high stairs; budget approximations (meals and transport heuristics) and travel times via haversine at typical road speeds; rainy-day alternatives prefer indoor venues not already used that day.
      - Trade-offs: Deterministic, heuristic planner over exact optimization; minimal dataset sized for demo; single container architecture to simplify ops; vanilla SPA to keep it lightweight.
      - Potential improvements:
          - Expand dataset with more venues and richer accessibility metadata.
          - Time-window constraints (opening hours), calendar awareness, and weekday-specific closures.
          - Multi-objective scoring (comfort, diversity) with user-adjustable weights.
          - Persist user presets client-side; printable PDF itinerary export.
          - Add unit tests and CI, and parameterize more costs per region.
